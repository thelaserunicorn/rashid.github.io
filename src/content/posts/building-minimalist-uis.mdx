Minimalism in web design isn&apos;t just about having less—it&apos;s about making what you have matter more. In this post, I&apos;ll share some principles I follow when designing clean, functional interfaces.

## The Power of White Space

White space (or negative space) is one of the most powerful tools in a designer&apos;s arsenal. It:

- Improves readability
- Creates visual hierarchy
- Guides the user&apos;s attention
- Makes interfaces feel premium

## Typography as Design

When you strip away decorations, typography becomes your primary design tool. Here are some tips:

### Choose the Right Font Pairing

A classic combination is a serif font for headings and a sans-serif for body text:

```css
h1, h2, h3 {
  font-family: 'Instrument Serif', Georgia, serif;
}

p, a, li {
  font-family: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

### Use Scale Wisely

Establish a clear type scale to create hierarchy:

```css
text-xs    = 0.75rem    /* 12px */
text-sm    = 0.875rem   /* 14px */
text-base  = 1rem       /* 16px */
text-lg    = 1.125rem  /* 18px */
text-xl    = 1.25rem   /* 20px */
text-2xl   = 1.5rem    /* 24px */
text-4xl   = 2.25rem   /* 36px */
```

## Color: Less Is More

For this blog, I used a restrained color palette inspired by Anthropic:

| Role | Color | Usage |
|------|-------|-------|
| Background | `#faf9f5` | Page background |
| Surface | `#f4f3ee` | Cards, code blocks |
| Text Primary | `#141413` | Headings, body |
| Text Secondary | `#b0aea5` | Muted text |
| Accent | `#d97757` | Links, highlights |

Notice how most of the palette is neutral, with a single accent color used sparingly.

## The Importance of Contrast

Always ensure your text has sufficient contrast with its background. The WCAG recommends:

- **4.5:1** for normal text
- **3:1** for large text (18px+ bold or 24px+ regular)

Tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) can help verify your choices.

## Conclusion

Minimalist design isn&apos;t about removing features or making things boring—it&apos;s about intentional restraint. By carefully choosing what to show and what to hide, you create experiences that feel thoughtful and refined.
