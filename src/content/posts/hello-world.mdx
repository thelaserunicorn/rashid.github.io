description: Welcome to my new blog built with Next.js

Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post, and I'm excited to share my thoughts here.

## Why Next.js?

I chose Next.js for this blog because:

- Excellent performance
- Great developer experience
- Static export for GitHub Pages

Here's a simple example of JavaScript code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

And here's some Python code:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```

Thanks for reading!
