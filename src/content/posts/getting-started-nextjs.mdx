Next.js has become one of the most popular frameworks for building React applications. In this post, I&apos;ll walk you through why I chose it for this blog and how you can get started.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages that make it an excellent choice for web development:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Better SEO and performance
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Perfect for blogs and portfolios
3. **File-based routing** - Simple and intuitive routing system
4. **API routes** - Build your backend without a separate server

## Setting Up Your First Project

Getting started is as simple as running a single command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog
```

This will prompt you with a few questions about your preferred configuration. For this blog, I chose:
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- App Router

## Key Concepts

### File-Based Routing

In Next.js 13+, you create routes by adding files to the `app` directory:

```
app/
├── page.tsx        # Homepage (/)
├── blog/
│   ├── page.tsx   # Blog listing (/blog)
│   └── [slug]/
│       └── page.tsx  # Dynamic blog posts (/blog/my-post)
```

### Static Export

For deployment to GitHub Pages, you can configure Next.js to export static files:

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  output: 'export',
}
```

This generates pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be hosted anywhere.

## Conclusion

Next.js provides an excellent developer experience while producing highly performant applications. Whether you&apos;re building a simple blog or a complex web application, it&apos;s worth considering for your next project.
